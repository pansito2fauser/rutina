## Today's Learning: How to do Deadbugs

Here we are. The very first core exercise of the program! Deadbugs. I cannot overstate just how important these are. They're essentially the holy grail of core exercises, because on top of being a really killer core exercise once you get good at them, they also teach you proper breathing mechanics as well as how to properly brace (which is super important for both weightliftin and bwf, and life really.).

That's something you won't get from pretty much any other core exercise. That's why, in spite of their complexity, I've added them into the BWF Primer, which is a program meant to focus on simplicity, but these are a little too important in my opinion to let slide (Especially as the sooner you learn them, the more you'll practice them, and the sooner you'll get good at them, and the sooner you will reap the benefits).

***P.S More-so than any other exercise guide so far, please don't get overwhelmed and think you have to understand it all and do the exercise perfectly on the first go. Do your best, but recognise it may take a while to really 'get' this exercise. Generally speaking, if it feels super easy, you're almost certainly not yet doing it right. Just keep trying!***

**P.P.S Due to the complexity of this guide, there will be no reading tomorrow, so you will be encouraged to simply come back to this guide and re-read it, to make sure you can really take your time to absorb the info and get a hold of the key concepts.**

## Workout #10:

&#x200B;

|Exercise|Sets/Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Deadbugs|3x10s|60s|
|Squats|2x7|60s|
|Glute Bridges|2x9|60s|
|Rows/Reverse Push-ups|2x11|60s|
|Push-ups|**2x12**|60s|

(Note, **3x10s** does not mean 3 sets of 10 reps. It means 3 sets of 10 *seconds*, as denoted by the 's'. This means you will do 3 sets of static deabug holds, holding each set for 10s.)

You'll notice that Push-ups have not increased from last time. Normally once you reach the top range of rep-range for an exercise, you would move on to the next progression (in this case, a lower inclination of push-ups). But as the 2 week build-up is more about learning than pushing yourself, you will be capping all your exercises at 12 reps until the 2 weeks is over. Once you move on to the full workout 3x per week, you will be free to progress as initially intended.

(RECORDATORIO: SI ESTÁS FALLANDO ALGUNA DE TUS SERIES, O INCLUSO ESTÁS CERCA DEL FALLO, ESTÁS YENDO **DEMASIADO DIFÍCIL**. ELIJE UNA VARIACIÓN DE EJERCICIO MÁS FÁCIL QUE PUEDAS HACER **VARIAS REPETICIONES MÁS SI QUISIERAS**. EL ENFOQUE DE ESTA FASE DE LA RUTINA PRIMER ESTÁ EN LA **PRÁCTICA Y EL APRENDIZAJE DE LA TÉCNICA**, NO EN LLEGAR AL LÍMITE NI NADA POR EL ESTILO. SI TE ESFUERZAS HASTA FALLAR 6 VECES POR SEMANA DURANTE DOS SEMANAS TE EXCEDERÁS MUCHÍSIMO Y TE AGOTARÁ RÁPIDAMENTE.)
