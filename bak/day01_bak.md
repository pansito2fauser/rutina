# BWF Primer Build-up Community Event: Day 1 (Happy New Year!)

# Before we Begin,

Just so people know what to plan and when to expect the next days' post,

**Every day at 18:00 GMT**, the next day post will be posted (this is because it is around the highest reddit activity of the day, while not being too late for me to respond to comments if needed)

(***Side note:*** For those in time-zones for whom this daily 18:00 GMT release date is too late for you to see the post, (or for those that just want to see the post ASAP), I will be posting the Day post on my own website at **00:01 GMT every day on** [**my website**](https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/reddit-bwf-primer/). It will be identical to the reddit post.  This means that Day 2 will launch on my site in under 4 hours from now for people to view on the other side of the globe from me. )

Hey folks! Nick-E here. Welcome

Many of you will be coming to exercise for the absolute first time ever. Some of you will be coming from time off and want to really ease your way back in, and yet still some others will be wanting to simply reinforce their foundations and knowledge by reading up on the daily readings!

In any case, thanks for coming!

The way the community workouts will be structured is that for the next 14 days, every day you can come onto the subreddit and there will be a workout for you and some informational reading. The reading will be split evenly between:

**Reading about how to properly perform an exercise**

and

**Reading about how training works**

In any other training program you would have to read all of the information spread across these 14 days in one go, or already know it, in order to start a strength training program and also know what you are doing. This 14 day spread should make it much more achievable to get the info in!

By the end of the 14 days, you will have eased your way straight in to the full BWF Primer Routine!

# Reading #1: Understanding Training Nomenclature:

**Reps:**

A 'rep' is short for 'repetition' and refers to a single execution of a movement. If you were to sit in a chair and extend your knee straight out in front of you and then return it to the start position, that is '1 rep' of a knee extension. If you did that 10 times in a row, thats '10 reps' of a knee extension.

**Sets:**

A set is a specified number of reps to perform of an exercise. If you do 10 knee extensions, then wait a bit, 10 more knee extensions, then wait a bit, and 10 more, you've just done 3 sets of 10 knee extensions. In most training programs, you will see this shortened to '3x10 knee extensions'. You can read the 'X' as 'sets of'.

3x10 = 3 sets of 10.

**Rest:**

This one is self explanatory, it is just the period of time between sets of an exercise where you rest. But more specifically, it refers to the amount of time that the parts of the body that are involved in an exercise are resting (not doing anything). You do not necessarily need to be completely immobilised during your rest periods (we can go into more detail on the implications of this on a later date.)

**Adding in Rep-ranges:**

You will see in this program and others, thigns looking like this:

3x5-8

This means '3 sets of 5 to 8 reps' and usually refers to a set progression scheme, where you will try to increase your reps performed by 1 rep every session within that range until you reach the top range, at which point you will move on to a harder exercise.

For example:

If you had a program that said 3x5-10 Squats. You would do your first workout doing 3x5 squats, and then next workout, try to do 3x6. If you succeeded, then next time do 3x7. If you succeeded, then next time do 3x8, etc. etc. etc. repeating until you can do 3x10 squats. Then you would move on to a harder exercise that works the same muscles, and start back at 3x5, repeating that process for the new harder exercise. This is the basis of how most simple strength training programs will work in bodyweight fitness given the lack of external weights to add on to make movements harder in a simpler way.

# Reading #2: How to do Push-ups (At any strength level).

The following is a guide I've made on how to do push-ups, which will be the very first exercise you learn in this program.

It's bit long, but if you set aside about (15-20 minutes?) you should be able to read through the whole thing, try it out a couple times, and feel relatively confident about how they work. The exercise in the section '**How to Build Up To a Push-up if You Can't Yet Do One'** will be the focal point of the guide for the purposes of this workout, but it is worth reading and trying to comprehend the whole thing.

[Nick-E's Push-up Guide](https://www.nick-e.com/push-up/)

Many if not all of the exercises in this routine (and in general) will appear simple to do, but will be deceptively complex to do **well**, so if you don't grasp 100% of the nuance in the guide in the first go-around, don't worry. You're not really expected to, we just want you to have access to it to check back and learn more over time.

Once you've finished that, head on down to the next section!

# Workout #1:

This workout is actually very quick and straightforward. It will likely not feel like a 'workout' in the sense that it tires you or makes you feel especially sore. Consider it more as a self-directed learning exercise. The workouts will become harder throughout the days, do not worry!

For today: **You will simply perform 5 sets of 5 reps of push-ups at whatever incline is appropriate for you, with 60 seconds of rest between sets (or however long it takes you to review your footage).** This would be written as:

5x5 (Incline) Push-ups, 60s rest.

*For reference, the '****appropriate intensity****' of these push-ups should be very* ***moderate***\*. The focus of this 14 day build-up to the full primer routine is technical competence, rather than pushing yourself. You should start by picking an intensity that you could easily do several more reps of if you wanted to. \****It should not feel trivially easy, but if you are struggling to manage 5 reps, or struggling to finish all sets, you've started out way too hard***\*. You will be exercising 6x per week in this period, and you don't want to be maiming yourself with intensity. Leave that for the full primer after the 2 weeks!\*

It is highly recommended that you film yourself from the side and front in your sets, so you can watch this footage back in your rests to evaluate your form and compare them to the videos in the above guide, so you can learn how to identify errors in your own form and improve independently!

# Ok, I did it!

Congratulations!

If you'd like, we'd love to hear your thoughts about your workout in the comments, as well as any questions you have about the concepts or forms you learned today.

Alternatively, we've set up a new 'beginners zone' in the communities' discord server, so you can come chat with other new exercisers in a friendly environment, with friendly helpers with experience with exercise that have volunteered to answer any questions you may have!
