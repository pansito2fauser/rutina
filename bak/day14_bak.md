Day 14 (Today!)

Hey folks! If you've made it this far, congratulations! You've just done 2 absolutely jam packed weeks and hopefully learned a lot about some fundamental exercises and theory about training!

This is your second rest day this week, so today we'll be doing:

\- Nothing,

\- Some more nothing!

# Today's Learning: Nothing. You've earned a break!

Simply bask in your achievement.

Or, If you missed anything this week reading-wise, today would be the day to go back and read (or re-read!) that.

# Workout #14:

&#x200B;

Rest Day.

# Final Remarks, and What to Do Moving Forward

So now that you've completed the 'Build-Up' phase of the Primer routine, you can move on to the normal, full capacity BWF primer.

This means now you are going to be only training 3x per week, but you'll be doing 3 sets of every exercise instead of 2, and you're finally going to start progressing to harder exercises once you reach the top rep range of an exercise!

For Clarity, this means your training days will look like this:

|Exercise|Sets/Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[Birddog Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/bird-dog) |3x6-10 reps each side (or 3x10-20s for Static holds)|60-90s|
|[Deadbug Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/deadbug/) |3x6-10 reps each side (or 3x10-20s for Static holds)|60-90s|
|[Push-up Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/push-up/) |3x5-12|60-90s|
|[Rows](https://www.nick-e.com/row/) (Or [Reverse Push-ups](https://www.nick-e.com/reverse-push-ups)) Progression |3x5-12|60-90s|
|[Squat Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/squat/) |3x8-15|60-90s|
|[Glute Bridge Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/glutebridge/) |3x8-15|60-90s|

With the rep ranges (e.g. 3x5-12) meaning you start your first session with the first number (e.g. 5 reps) and every session you will try to increase that by one rep (or 2-3s), until you get to the second number (e.g. 12) at which point you will move up in progression to a harder exercise, and start back at 5 reps again!

This will be performed 3x a week rather than 6x a week, so if you want examples of what schedule that may look like, go back and look at [Day 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ksiox7/bwf_primer_buildup_community_event_day_7/) when we covered this very topic!

To read the full details of the program, go back and look at the technical outline posted on Christmas:

Heres to a year of getting and staying fit, and taking care of ourselves.

Cheers,
