Hey gang, Nick-E here.

Now you've had a few days to get used to your upper body training, its time to give the bottom half of your body a little bit of love! This is an area of BWF that is a little bit more limited, because just from walking around and going up stairs, etc. your legs are already quite good at supporting your whole bodyweight, so the scope to work them even harder (given that you only weigh so much) is much more limited than with weights, but there's still quite a bit to do before you've 'maxed out' your exercising potential within bwf, so to speak!

So today we will be doing:

\- A reading on how to do Glute Bridges

\- A workout with push-ups, rows, and glute bridges!

# Today's Learning: How to do Glute Bridges

Today's form reading will actually be quite short! The Glute Bridge is a relatively simple movement.

[Check it out here!](https://www.nick-e.com/glutebridge/)

As you'll see in the guide there are multiple progressions available to you, but for now we are going to start with the standard two foot glute bridge. As you progress, you can move on to the single leg variation! (Once you're all done with that in a few weeks, you can play around with the hamstring bridges mentiond at the end of the guide, and even eventually move on to hardest bridge variation: the single leg hamstring bridge curl. oooooh, spooky.)

# Workout #5:

|Exercise|Sets-x-Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Glute Bridges|3x5|60s|
|Rows/Reverse Push-ups|3x7|60s|
|Push-ups|3x9|60s|

(REMINDER: IF YOU ARE FAILING ANY OF YOUR SETS, OR EVEN PUSHING CLOSE TO FAILURE, YOU ARE WORKING **WAY TOO HARD**. PICK AN EASIER LEVEL OF INCLINATION/EXERCISE VARIATION THAT YOU COULD DO **SEVERAL MORE REPS OF IF YOU HAD TO**. THE FOCUS OF THIS PHASE OF THE PRIMER ROUTINE IS ON **TECHNIQUE PRACTICE AND LEARNING**, NOT PUSHING YOURSELF TO YOUR LIMIT OR EVEN CLOSE. IF YOU PUSH YOURSELF TO FAILURE 6x A WEEK FOR TWO WEEKS YOU WILL BE MASSIVELY OVERDOING IT AND BURN OUT QUICKLY.)

# Ok, I did it!

Congratulations!

If you'd like, we'd love to hear your thoughts about your workout in the comments, as well as any questions you have about the concepts or forms you learned today.

Alternatively, we've set up a new 'beginners zone' in our communities' discord server, so you can come chat with other new exercisers in a friendly environment, with friendly helpers with experience with exercise that have volunteered to answer any questions you may have!
