Hey folks! Nick-E here.

So yesterday was a whole lot of reading. Some of you may have got the hang out of it, some of you may not have. Some of you may be in the unfortunately common camp of 'that felt way too easy I don't think it's even doing anything'. For those in the last 2 camps, don't worry. Like I mentioned in the last post and also in the deadbug guide, it takes some practice to learn properly, and it is not simply holding the position however you can that's hard, it's the exact process of bracing with the right muscles to hold that position, with minimal air in your lungs. That takes a lot of practice and experimentation to figure out.

Anyway, today:

\- Going back over the deadbug guide

\- Another workout!

# Today's Learning:

As I've said a few times now, yesterday's reading on the Deadbug was a real doozy, so to cut you a bit of slack and not overwhelm you with information, your reading for today is to go back over all that information, take your time to practice all the different breathing and core activation drills to really consolidate all the info best as you can.

# [Deadbug Guide](https://www.nick-e.com/deadbug/)

# Workout #11:

|Exercise|Sets/Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Static Deadbug Hold|3x10s|60s|
|Squats|2x8|60s|
|Glute Bridges|2x10|60s|
|Rows/Reverse Push-ups|**2x12**|60s|
|Push-ups|**2x12**|60s|

(REMINDER: IF YOU ARE FAILING ANY OF YOUR SETS, OR EVEN PUSHING CLOSE TO FAILURE, YOU ARE WORKING **WAY TOO HARD**. PICK AN EASIER LEVEL OF INCLINATION/EXERCISE VARIATION THAT YOU COULD DO **SEVERAL MORE REPS OF IF YOU HAD TO**. THE FOCUS OF THIS PHASE OF THE PRIMER ROUTINE IS ON **TECHNIQUE PRACTICE AND LEARNING**, NOT PUSHING YOURSELF TO YOUR LIMIT OR EVEN CLOSE. IF YOU PUSH YOURSELF TO FAILURE 6x A WEEK FOR TWO WEEKS YOU WILL BE MASSIVELY OVERDOING IT AND BURN OUT QUICKLY.)

# Ok, I did it!
