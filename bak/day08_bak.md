Hey folks, Nick-E here. Check us out! Starting our second week of training. Good job officially breezing past the halfway mark of the community exercise event!

Without further ado, lets jump right into what we're going to be doing today:

\- Learning a new movement. Squats! Ostensibly simple, yet deceptively complex!

\- Adding some squats into our workout!

# Today's Learning: How to do Squats

Squats, as mentioned above, seem like something that would be very simple to do. They seem only slightly different to sitting down into an invisible chair (something we do with visible, real chairs all the time!).

However, the technique is just different enough that it's a bit tricky to get the hang of without a good bit of practice, and out of all the movements in this routine, it is the one that the most people are likely to experience issues with due to insufficient mobility. In particular, tight ankles and hips are often the plague of the squatter, from beginner to advanced. Luckily, using the guide below, you should find ***a form*** and/or variation of squats that works for your current level of mobility.

Just to emphasise, if you can't get it right away, don't get frustrated or discouraged. It will most likely be mobility moreso than coordination that is limiting you.

# Workout #8:

|Exercise|Sets/Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Squats|2x5|60s|
|Glute Bridges|2x7|60s|
|Rows/Reverse Push-ups|2x9|60s|
|Push-ups|2x11|60s|

(REMINDER: IF YOU ARE FAILING ANY OF YOUR SETS, OR EVEN PUSHING CLOSE TO FAILURE, YOU ARE WORKING **WAY TOO HARD**. PICK AN EASIER LEVEL OF INCLINATION/EXERCISE VARIATION THAT YOU COULD DO **SEVERAL MORE REPS OF IF YOU HAD TO**. THE FOCUS OF THIS PHASE OF THE PRIMER ROUTINE IS ON **TECHNIQUE PRACTICE AND LEARNING**, NOT PUSHING YOURSELF TO YOUR LIMIT OR EVEN CLOSE. IF YOU PUSH YOURSELF TO FAILURE 6x A WEEK FOR TWO WEEKS YOU WILL BE MASSIVELY OVERDOING IT AND BURN OUT QUICKLY.)

# Ok, I did it!
