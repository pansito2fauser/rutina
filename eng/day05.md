## Today's Learning: How to do Glute Bridges

Today's form reading will actually be quite short! The Glute Bridge is a relatively simple movement.

[Check it out here!](https://www.nick-e.com/glutebridge/)

As you'll see in the guide there are multiple progressions available to you, but for now we are going to start with the standard two foot glute bridge. As you progress, you can move on to the single leg variation! (Once you're all done with that in a few weeks, you can play around with the hamstring bridges mentiond at the end of the guide, and even eventually move on to hardest bridge variation: the single leg hamstring bridge curl. oooooh, spooky.)

## Workout #5:

|Exercise|Sets-x-Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Glute Bridges|3x5|60s|
|Rows/Reverse Push-ups|3x7|60s|
|Push-ups|3x9|60s|

(REMINDER: IF YOU ARE FAILING ANY OF YOUR SETS, OR EVEN PUSHING CLOSE TO FAILURE, YOU ARE WORKING **WAY TOO HARD**. PICK AN EASIER LEVEL OF INCLINATION/EXERCISE VARIATION THAT YOU COULD DO **SEVERAL MORE REPS OF IF YOU HAD TO**. THE FOCUS OF THIS PHASE OF THE PRIMER ROUTINE IS ON **TECHNIQUE PRACTICE AND LEARNING**, NOT PUSHING YOURSELF TO YOUR LIMIT OR EVEN CLOSE. IF YOU PUSH YOURSELF TO FAILURE 6x A WEEK FOR TWO WEEKS YOU WILL BE MASSIVELY OVERDOING IT AND BURN OUT QUICKLY.)
