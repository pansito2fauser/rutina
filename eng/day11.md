# Day 11

## Today's Learning:

As I've said a few times now, yesterday's reading on the Deadbug was a real doozy, so to cut you a bit of slack and not overwhelm you with information, your reading for today is to go back over all that information, take your time to practice all the different breathing and core activation drills to really consolidate all the info best as you can.

## Workout #11:

|Exercise|Sets/Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Static Deadbug Hold|3x10s|60s|
|Squats|2x8|60s|
|Glute Bridges|2x10|60s|
|Rows/Reverse Push-ups|**2x12**|60s|
|Push-ups|**2x12**|60s|

(REMINDER: IF YOU ARE FAILING ANY OF YOUR SETS, OR EVEN PUSHING CLOSE TO FAILURE, YOU ARE WORKING **WAY TOO HARD**. PICK AN EASIER LEVEL OF INCLINATION/EXERCISE VARIATION THAT YOU COULD DO **SEVERAL MORE REPS OF IF YOU HAD TO**. THE FOCUS OF THIS PHASE OF THE PRIMER ROUTINE IS ON **TECHNIQUE PRACTICE AND LEARNING**, NOT PUSHING YOURSELF TO YOUR LIMIT OR EVEN CLOSE. IF YOU PUSH YOURSELF TO FAILURE 6x A WEEK FOR TWO WEEKS YOU WILL BE MASSIVELY OVERDOING IT AND BURN OUT QUICKLY.)
